## Project overview

A team project built over 6 days using Vue.js, Express.js and MongoDB, Pub Quiz Buddy is an interactive map that displays pub quizzes across Edinburgh, Scotland. Users are able to filter existing quizzes by day and click on a marker to get information about that quiz. For quiz enthusiasts, there is also the posibility to add a new quiz to the map.

The Google maps and places API: 
- Render a map of Edinburgh and populate markers using location data in the database. 
- Implement an auto-complete feature when adding a new quiz which gathers the location data of a given establishment and uses this to create a new marker and add it to the database.
